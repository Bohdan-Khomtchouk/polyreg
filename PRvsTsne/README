The t-sne method, implemented in R in the Rtsne package, is a method for
nonlinear projection of data into a two-dimensional submanifold, just
like plotting the first 2 principle components in PCA.

But t-sne is finicky; choose the wrong values for tuning parameters, and
you get garbage.  See the excellent account at
